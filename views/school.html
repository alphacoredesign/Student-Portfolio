                I am currently attending Oklahoma State University, seeking a Bachelors degree in M.I.S. from the Spears School of Business. My anticipated graduation date is May 2016, although I'll be sad to leave this University I can't wait to get my career started in the IT field. Oklahoma State is a great university, there is always something new to do. Whether it be going to a Google Developers Group meeting, studying in the library, or screaming in Boone Pickens Stadium. OSU has a lot to offer to help you be successful in your field. On top of the many activities available, there is also many job fairs to attend. Oklahoma State wants to make sure students not only succeed in the classroom, but also in life. Some of my favorite classes that I have taken at OSU would be Marketing with Professor Manzer. He was an awesome Professor and I learned a lot not just about marketing, but about being successful in my career. I also enjoyed my advanced programming course with Professor Steelman, who encouraged me to build my website and showcase what I can do. I look forward to the next classes I have at OSU that involve my major. I hope to continue to learn and hone my skills to help develop a successful career in my field
